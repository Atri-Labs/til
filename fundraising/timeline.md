# When a VC asks you “what’s your timeline?”... 

## What does a VC want to know?

- If there is demand and competition for the deal
- If they have sufficient time for due-diligence
- If the founder is organized and sophisticated about the fundraising process

## Example of a good answer

```
Well, I’ve had a couple early meetings but most of our first meetings are scheduled over the next two weeks. I’ve been really happy with the response so far. More and more investor intros keep coming in and and so I think *knock on wood* the process will continue to run smoothly. I don't know how long processes are taking nowadays, but we hope to wrap this up sooner rather than later. We'd love to get back to work.

## Elements of a good answer

- Indication of early interest - “had a couple early meetings” 
- Running a process / driving a timeline - “first meetings scheduled over the next two weeks…”
- Ambiguous reference to lots of meetings (demand) - “first meetings scheduled over the next two weeks…”
- Confidence in a quick close, push that they need to move on this - “don’t know how long processes are taking, but hope to wrap up sooner rather than later. We’d love to get back to work”
- Nod to being a good operator - “We’d love to get back to work”
