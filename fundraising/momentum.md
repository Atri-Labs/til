# How to generate momentum during a fundraising process?

## Rule #1: Urgency 

- Fundraising should be a CEO's only job during the process. Delegate everything else to your co-founder and team.
- Meet as many investors as feasible. 

## Rule #2: Momentum

Imagine a scenario where the founder wants to raise \$700k. 

| Order | Activity | Stakeholders | Conversation |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | Initiate fundraise for Tranche 1 | Founder &rarr; All investors | We are wrapping up a small tranche of \$200k at \$3.5m post valuation |
| 2 | Take a bunch of meetings back to back ||
| 3 | Move to 2nd meetings| Founder &rarr; All investors | We are now moving into 2nd meetings with a handful of VCs.|
| 4 | Received checks for Tranche 1| Founder &rarr; All investors | The \$3.5m tranche has been filled. I am now talking with some larger potential investors about a higher valuation. Let me know if it makes sense for you to take the next step. |
| 5 | Received term sheet from Fund 1 (\$500k at $4m post) and a verbal commitment from Fund 2 but no proposal | Founder &rarr; Fund 1 | \$4m is probably not going to work because there's another fund that wants to take the whole thing at a higher valuation. |
| 6 | | Founder &rarr; Fund 2 | We have already received an offer from a fund but we are trying to find the best fit. Are you open to investing at \$6m? I can sign today. |
| 7 | Fund 2 is dragging its feet while Fund 1 is pressuring the founder to accept their offer.  | Founder &rarr; Fund 2 | We have to make a decision on our other offer asap. Please let us know if you are still interested. |
| 8 | Received term sheet from Fund 2 (\$500k at $6m post) | Founder &rarr; Fund 1 | I can't take your offer because I have received another offer at \$6m. However, if you bump up the valuation to \$7m, we've got a deal today. |
| 9 | Received term sheet from Fund 1 (\$500k at $7m post) | Founder &rarr; Fund 1 | Done! |
