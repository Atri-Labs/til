# Setting up a fundraising process

## Step 1: Softwares

- [ ] [Mail Merge](https://YAMM.com)
- [ ] Calendly
- [ ] DocSend

## Step 2: Connectors

Create a list of folks who can provide intros to investors. 

1. Start with LinkedIn connections. 
   - Go to https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/member-data and "Get a copy of your data" to export a list of your contacts in a spreadsheet.

2. Review emails from the last 6-12 months.

3. Review WhatsApp chats.

## Step 3: Target Investors 

Create a list of **at least 100** target investors depending on your network, your industry and stage. 

1. Start with investors with whom you are connected on LinkedIn/email/WhatsApp.

2. Add investors that your supporters have strong connections with.

3. From the available investor databases, choose those who respond to cold outreach.

## Step 4: Map your intros

Map your connectors with your target investors. 

## Step 5: Ask for intros

### Mechanisms of an intro request

|      | Activity               | Stakeholders                   |
| ---  | :---:                  | :---:                          |
|1     | Ask for intro          | You &rarr; Connector           |
|2     | Forwardable email      | You &rarr; Connector           |
|3     | Check-in with target   | Connector &rarr; Target        |
|4     | Actual Introduction    | Connector &rarr; Target + You  |
|5     | Intro Reply            | You &rarr; Target + You        |

Since there are several steps involved in getting an intro, make this process easier for your connector by 
- being very specific about why you are interested in meeting a target
- giving them copy to use in their outreach (beyond just the forwardable email)
- giving them a deadline so that they allocate time for sending the intro request
- sending them a reminder

### Example of a good intro

```
Hey [INVESTOR] - I just chatted with the CEO of [COMPANY]. They might be raising soon. 

CEO told me they just [EXCITING POINT 1], [EXCITING POINT 2], [EXCITING POINT 3] and already have [AWESOME INVESTOR] on board.

Feels like a great fit for what you look at. Should I connect you?
```

Whether it’s through a more detailed blurb, coaching the connector on what to say/write, or just focusing on delivering real progress in your business, your goal should be to make it as easy as possible for connectors to make this type of intros - Intros that connectors will be eager to make and will tell investors, “Thank me later…”

## Step 6: Investor Meetings

Setup a CRM system to track the different stages of conversations.
