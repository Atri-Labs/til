# How to plan an intro request?

## Mechanisms of an intro request

|      | Activity               | Stakeholders                   |
| ---  | :---:                  | :---:                          |
|1     | Ask for intro          | You &rarr; Connector           |
|2     | Forwardable email      | You &rarr; Connector           |
|3     | Check-in with target   | Connector &rarr; Target        |
|4     | Actual Introduction    | Connector &rarr; Target + You  |
|5     | Intro Reply            | You &rarr; Target + You        |

Since there are several steps involved in getting an intro, make this process easier for your connector by 
- being very specific about why you are interested in meeting a target
- giving them copy to use in their outreach (beyond just the forwardable email)
- giving them a deadline so that they allocate time for sending the intro request
- sending them a reminder
