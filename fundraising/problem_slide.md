# Tips to write problem slide

## What kind of language should you use in problem slide?

-   Choose strong words or emotionally charged expressions.
-   Use images.
-   Avoid a problem statement that falls in one of the category:
    -   Societal problems != Customer's problem

## How much information should be there in the slide?

-   Write the slide from perspective of a single kind of user persona. If trying to involve more personas, be extra careful to avoid confusing VCs.
-   Don't use redundant points like `bad user experience`.
-   Show original source of number/facts quoted.

## How should the slide look?

-   The layout should be simple so that it's easy to grasp the presented information. The layout must establish some hierarchy in the information presented.
-   The slides should have some style pattern. In other words, the look and feel should be consistent.
