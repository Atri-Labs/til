## How to add a TIL?
1. Create a [fork of this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository). 

2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#cloning-a-fork) your fork. 

```shell
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/framework-docs.git
```

3. Configure the remotes. 

```shell
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory
cd framework-docs

# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Atri-Labs/framework-docs.git
```

4. Add a new .md file for your TIL in an existing folder or create a new folder.

5. Open a [Pull Request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) with clear title and description.
