# Today I learned
A compendium of "Today I Learned" snippets

## Objective of this repository

1. Record our learnings in an organized manner
2. Build a writing habit
3. Demonstrate our learning culture

## How to add a TIL?
1. Create a [fork of this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository). 

2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#cloning-a-fork) your fork. 

```shell
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/framework-docs.git
```

3. Configure the remotes. 

```shell
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory
cd framework-docs

# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Atri-Labs/framework-docs.git
```

4. Add an extension for spelling and grammar checks in your editor. 
- In VS Code, we suggest [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker).
- In PyCharm, we suggest [Grazie](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12175-grazie).

5. Add an extension to preview markdown. 
- In VS Code, we suggest [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced).

6. Add a new .md file for your TIL in an existing folder or create a new folder.

7. Open a [Pull Request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) with clear title and description.
