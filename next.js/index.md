# Next.JS

There are many aspects of Next.JS that is interesting, hence, in this TIL series, I would like to uncover some of the mysteries from the Next.JS code base.

Software Developers, How can you grow your experience by a year just over a weekend?

The answer is by reading open source code.

One of the most beautiful aspect of open source project is that it's the best way to learn from most amazing developers around the world. The best developers don't have time to create online content/courses, hence, reading their code from their open source projects is the only way.

In last one year, I have read code of dozens of open source projects. I also wrote an article on what I learned from projects like `create-react-app` [here](https://medium.com/@swaroopshyam0/walkthrough-of-create-react-app-codebase-b07d94e6c4d6). I am currently compiling my learnings from the Next.JS and Remix codebase.

If you are interested in contributing/learning together, please comment `interested`, so that I can add you to the reading group.
