# Time management

## Problem
As a CEO, there are always multiple "important" things that I could be working on at a time. 

## Current Process

Start `Task 1` without deciding its priority 

&darr; 

remember `Task 1.1`, `Task 1.2`, `Task 2`,..., &rarr; 

&darr; 

jump to details of `Task 1.2` without completing `Task 1`

## Solution

1. Just as submitting PR before opening an issue is not recommended, similarly, first add a task in the [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/Atri-Labs/projects/6/views/1) when you remember it. 

2. Plan tasks for the next 6 hours and add them in the `Plan` column of the `Tracker` spreadsheet.

3. As a task is finished, update the `Actual` column of the `Tracker` spreadsheet.
