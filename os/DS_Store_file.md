# What is a .DS_Store file?

## Abbreviation

.DS_Store = Desktop Services Stores

## What is this file?

It is an invisible file on the macOS Operating System that is automatically created anytime you look into the folder with `Finder`.

## Why should we care about it?

- This file follows the folder everywhere it goes, including when archived, like in ‘ZIP.’

- This file stores custom attributes/metadata of its containing folder and the names of other files around it. 

Exposing this information could potentially allow hackers to act maliciously and let them see private files.
