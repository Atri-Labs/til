# Bad revenue

## Misleading belief among VCs

`All fast revenue growth is good despite the unprofitability.`

## Examples of bad revenue

1. Transactions that are unprofitable on a unit basis
- You need `patient capital` 
- You should be able to demonstrate how the network effects from growth help increase your revenue on a `unit basis`. 

2. Cases when the payback period is too long (6+ months)

## When incentives diverge

- Most VCs encourage founders to pursue bad revenue in the short term. The rationale is that in case the network effects will eventually kick in, it will make for a very attractive bet. 

- From a founder's perspective, it can be better to instead identify and cut bad revenue to get to profitability for companies without network effects. 

`For a founder, the best place to be in is when you don't need to rely on investors for your company's survivability.`

`Remember you started your company for YOU. Not for investors.`
